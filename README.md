# BinaPost Mobile App

The `BinaPost` app is a Flutter-based social media showcase application built with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and visual appeal. This project was developed in response to a developer test and serves as a demonstration of effective MVVM structuring, Firebase integration, media handling, and custom UI implementation.

BinaPost is created entirely in Flutter using `Provider` as the state management solution. The application demonstrates best practices in app architecture, modular folder structure, testing, and user experience.

## Folder Structure

Here is the folder structure used in this project:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users/
â”œâ”€â”€ home_page.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ app.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
```

### Folder Breakdown

- **models/** â€“ Contains Post and User model classes.
- **viewmodels/** â€“ State logic using ChangeNotifier (e.g., PostViewModel, UserViewModel).
- **views/** â€“ Contains all UI screens including Home, Posts, and Users.
- **widgets/** â€“ Reusable widgets like PostCard, CustomVideoPlayer, etc.
- **theme/** â€“ Light and dark theme setup.
- **core/config/** â€“ App constants, dimensions, and colors.
- **main.dart** â€“ App entry point, routes, theme mode bindings.

## Controllers (ViewModels)

```
viewmodels/
|- post_view_model.dart
|- user_view_model.dart
|- theme_view_model.dart
```

---

## Widgets
Reusable components found in:
```
widgets/
|- post_card.dart
|- custom_video_player.dart
```

---

## Testing
Unit tests are included for ViewModels using mock Firebase calls:
```
test/
|- widget_test.dart
```

---

## Main Entry

`main.dart` initializes Firebase, sets up providers, and loads the app with dynamic theme switching support.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## Conclusion

BinaPost is built to demonstrate expertise in clean architecture, Firebase integration, user experience, and production-ready app design. The structure allows for rapid iteration, maintainability, and feature scalability.
